movie experience and metadata manager - meamm

problem:
there are plenty of "movie managers", "movie browsers" and "video collection managers" out there. however, despite of their name, all the programs i've seen so far do no such thing - they are all merely movie metadata managers. all these programs out there can do is keep you well-informed about the movies you have, they do not help you manage anything but data within besaid programs. i need a program capable of actually helping me with my home cinema experience.

discussion:
write a piece of software including but not limited to the following features:

	metadata management
		maintain a list of one's movie collection including all desired metadata, possibly imported from imdb or similar (that is what all the others do)
		find trailers on youtube
		logging which films are watched when, support for rating and commenting movie to be uploaded to imdb account or similar
	file management
		automate keeping database up to date with respect to present film files
		work together with rtorrent in adding new movies to database
		move and or rename files with the usage of metadata
		synchronise movie collection (partially) between different storage media/computers
		getting trailers and/or subtitles
	home cinema management
		support for location profiles including settings for external software such as x (a specific xorg.conf file) or vlc (what screen to use for fullscreen)
